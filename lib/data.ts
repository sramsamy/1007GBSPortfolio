            To understand the complexities of my professional trajectory, self-awareness is an important trait to develop as it allows us to find a career that matches our interests, values, skills, personality, and strengths.

I leveraged the insights from the Holland Code career test, where I’ve confirmed my passion for theory, research, and intellectual inquiry, particularly in the realms of science and technology. This aligns closely with my aspiration to thrive as a full stack developer. 

Utilising resources likes Griffith University’s “Defining your Values” worksheet, I’ve been able to explore my core values. The following values resonate deeply with me:
•	Diversity
•	adventurous spirit, 
•	problem-solving, 
•	moral fulfillment,
•	continuous learning, 
•	teamwork 
•	honesty
•	analytical skills
•	respect for others

Through introspection, I’ve scrutinised past achievements to reveal the skills that propelled me forward, shaping the way for informed skill development and enhancement. By undertaking the MBTI personality test, I’ve gained insights into how my personality traits intersect with career choices, providing an understanding of my professional compatibility. Lastly, through the scientific survey tool on the Institute of Character, I’ve identified my top strengths – Kindness, forgiveness, curiosity humility and leadership. – alongside areas for growth such as creativity and spirituality. This comprehensive understanding serves as a compass guiding my career path, ensuring alignment with my intrinsic attributes and aspirations.
